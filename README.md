# üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems Project ‚Äì Process Scheduling Simulator (C#)

This project simulates a simplified operating system written in C#, supporting key OS concepts such as:

- **Process scheduling** using pluggable policies (e.g., First Come First Served, Highest Index).
- **Context switching** and simulated CPU execution with a basic instruction language.
- **Disk interaction**, allowing processes to read specific tokens from a shared file asynchronously.
- **Performance metrics**, such as average turnaround time and maximal starvation.

The system executes pseudo-code files with control flow, conditions, file reading, and output writing. Each process has its own console, memory space, and is managed by a central OS kernel. The simulation enables experimentation with different scheduling strategies and process behaviors.
